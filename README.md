# React Book Library Project
Project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/frameworks) that focuses on using a JavaScript framework. For this project I chose to learn React. The application allows users to create and edit a personal digital library of books. Local Storage is used.

# Concepts/technologies I practiced using:
- create-react-app
- Class/functional components
- State
- Props
- localStorage

# To run
Clone the repository. Then run the following from the directory root:
```$ npm install```
```$ npm start```
